# Jisc Publications Router API v3

Jisc Publications Router exposes an REST API that may be used to submit and/or retrieve publication notifications. These pages document the API interfaces and data formats.

**This version has now been superseded by [v4](../v4/README.md), and should NOT be used for new developments.  It has a proposed end-of-life date of June 2023.**

All URL paths in this documentation will extend from this base url.

In all cases you will need an API key to access the API.  This can be obtained from your Publications Router account page.

### Contents ###

* [API for sending notifications](./Send.md) (Publishers)
* [API for retrieving notifications](./Retrieve.md) (CRIS and Repositories)
* [API for changing matching configuration](./Config.md) (CRIS and Repositories)

### Alternatives to REST API ###

These pages describe Publications Router's REST API, however there are other means by which Publishers may send information to Publications Router (SWORD2 or FTP); and by which Repositories may receive information (SWORD2).  More information on these is available on the  Publications Router website [introduction](https://pubrouter.jisc.ac.uk/about/) and [technical overview](https://pubrouter.jisc.ac.uk/about/resources/).
