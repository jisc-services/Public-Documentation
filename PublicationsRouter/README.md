# Publications Router #

Jisc Publications Router is one of Jisc's Open Access services.  It is concerned with the automated distribution (routing) of Open Access articles and associated metadata to the repositories of UK institutions that have signed up to the service.  Some of these articles (either AM or Vor) come direct from publishers that have agreed to work with Publications Router, others are harvested from sources such as EPMC, Crossref, PubMed.

Further information, including technical overview, is available on the Publications Router website https://pubrouter.jisc.ac.uk/.

The pages available in this repository describe the services provided by Publications Router, including its [RESTful API](./api/v3/README.md).
