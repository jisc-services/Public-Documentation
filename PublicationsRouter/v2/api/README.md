# Jisc Publications Router API (PubRouter API)

Jisc Publications Router exposes an REST API that may be used to submit and/or retrieve publication notifications. These pages document the API interfaces and data formats.

The current version of the API is v3, and it can be accessed at

    https://pubrouter.jisc.ac.uk/api/v3

All URL paths in this documentation will extend from this base url.

In many cases you will need an API key to access the API.  This can be obtained from your PubRouter account page.

### Contents ###

* [API for sending notifications (Publishers)](./Send.md)
* [API for retrieving notifications](./Retrieve.md)
* [API for changing matching configuration](/Config.md)

### Alternatives to REST API ###

These pages describe PubRouter's REST API, however there are other means by which Publishers may send information to PubRouter (SWORD2 or FTP); and by which Repositories may receive information (OAI-PMH and SWORD2).  More information on these is available on the  PubRouter website [introduction](https://pubrouter.jisc.ac.uk/about/) and [technical overview](https://pubrouter.jisc.ac.uk/about/resources/).
